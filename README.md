# MSc_project
Code used for my master's project.

Here can you find three main notebooks for the analysis of the simulation data. They are divided into the different parts of my project:
- Pt1: Varying properties of the progenitor including varying its mass, and its radius. It is in total 5 different models including the fiducial model
- Pt2: Varying the radial velocity for the trace-back simulations. It is in total 3 different models including the fiducial model
- Pt3: Varying the mass of the DM halo for the externam potential. It is in total 3 different models including the fiducial model

Analysis_funcitons.ipynb includes the analysis functions used in the analysis notebooks.
Visualisation_functions.ipynb includes functions for plotting and makin animations of the data.
The other files are either for analysing the test-simulations that were made to better understand how the programmes worked, or is discarded code that might be useful for other analysis.

More information might be added later.
